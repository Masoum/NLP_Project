# NLP Project

In this project, you are expected to perform NLP on an online dataset that you will obtain from an API or scraping.

This is an open-ended project, and you can be creative!

### Requirements:
- Obtain data from an API or web-scraping. No premade datasets from Kaggle!
- You are epxected to work on some form of **text data**.
- Your goal is to uncover underlying clusters (social communities, market patters) etc., using unsupervised learning.
- You can use any method; clustering, sentiment analysis, dimensionality reduction, pretrained models, word-embeddings, network embeddings, etc.
- Create a visualization in 2d or 3d of the data with the clusters you found tagged. See reddit example below.
- Analyze the produced clusters and use them to provide a short explanation of what you found.

**You don't have to do it at a large scale**

The data for these sort of projects can run very large if you let them, making the enterprise difficult.

You can limit yourself to samples of the communities you're looking at rather than the entire thing.

Please focus on exploring multiple techniques, understanding which ones would be most applicable, and interpreting the final results.

### Good Luck!
