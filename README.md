# NLP + LLMs 

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

Applications of NLP include sentiment analysis, translation, chatbots, text summarization, etc.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of pretrained models, characterized by their enormous size and the complexity of their architectures. They are typically trained on vast amounts of text data and have billions of parameters, enabling them to perform a wide range of language tasks with high accuracy and minimal fine-tuning.
